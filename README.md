RBM-Website
===========
Django website for RBM Library. 

How to install
==============

1. Ensure you have git, python and virtualenv installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to the desired location.
3. Setup a database and configure the default database on line 25 of rbm\_website/settings.py, by default it looks for a postgresql with a database named dbn\_database, a user called postgres with the password postgres.
4. Run install.sh to create virtual env, install required packages into it, clean database and setup git hooks. 
5. Run both run\_webserver.sh and run\_celery.sh in seperate terminals. The celery terminal will display output when it trains an RBM and any errors related to that.
6. Visit the url shown by run\_webserver.sh to see the site. 

Some configuration options
===========
In rbm\_website you can configure FLIPPED\_DBNS to be the list of id's of rbms who you want black pixels to be treated as white and vice versa.

You can also configure which DBN displays on the front page by editting HOME\_DBN with the corrosponding dbn's id.

Importing our pre trainined handwritten digits DBN.
===========
Make sure you have registered at least one user before doing this using the sign up page on the website. 
Run the following commands in the root website folder (where the README.md file is)

./activate

python load\_handwritten\_digits.py

Now go to the website and note down the ID of the new Handwritten digits DBN (the number in its url / in the list)
Now open rbm\_website/settings.py and add its ID to the FLIPPED\_DBNS list.

So for example after runnin load\_handwritten\_digits.py you go to the website and see that on the DBN list there is a new dbn with a 8 to its left. Now open up rbm\_website/settings.py find on line 37 
```
FLIPPED_DBNS = [12]
```
and change it to
```
FLIPPED_DBNS = [8]
```

where 8 is whatever ID of the new DBN.

This is because the MNIST dataset we used to train this DBN treated black pixels as white and vice versa. 

!!! Important !!!
===========
Make sure you always have the virtual enviroment activated when working on the website.
Run activate or "source venv/bin/activate" or "source venv/bin/activate.csh" to activate the virtual enviroment.

The git hooks will update requirements.txt every time you commit with whatever packages you have installed to pip.  

Running the Website:
===========

Once in the virtual environment, run 'python manage.py runserver' to setup the local server. If it runs correctly, it will output the address of the home page. Alternatively you can just use run\_webserver.sh to do the same thing.

Running Celery:
===========
Celery is used to run the background tasks such as training. To edit these tasks, look at tasks.py. To start celery, run the following: ```python manage.py celeryd -v 2 -B -s celery -E -l INFO```
